<h2>THE HUMOUR OF TRAVEL</h2>

<p>There is nothing insular about <span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>. Judging by his features,
familiar though these be and long as they have been typical of English
humour, he is not without some trace of foreign origin. Indeed, we fancy
that were a very searching enquiry to be made into his ancestry we might
find he had a far-off forebear who was, let us say, Italian! Perhaps we
have here the explanation of his breadth of mind and wide sympathy
which, however deeply rooted in the good soil of old England, are by no
means absolutely delimited by our coast line.</p>

<p>It is thus that we find him consistently the best of travelling
companions, for there is none he is more ready to castigate with the
whip of his satire than the insular Englishman abroad. This is as it
should be, and in these days of the <i>entente cordiale</i> especially, when
the inducements to Continental travel are steadily increasing, all
patriotic Englishmen are anxious that their fellow-countrymen should
give as good an account of themselves as possible when visiting the fair
lands of our friends across the silver streak.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Punch</span>, while always ready to stand for English ideals of right and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
fair-dealing, has equally endeavoured throughout his long career to show
that all the good manners of Europe are not to be found on the
Continent. But above all, wherever he goes, let his travels be within
those green isles where he reigns as king of fun or as far afield as the
land of the Sphinx, he diffuses that good humour which is the essential
characteristic of the Englishman and adds so much to the joy of life.
The present collection, illustrative of the humours of travel at home
and abroad, certainly does not bear out the ancient criticism as to the
English taking their pleasures sadly. Like many another book in this
same library it proves rather that they take their misadventures
joyously.</p>

guide taking her and her party to see the Papal Bulls of which she had
always heard so much. "I suppose," she said, "they're kept on some farm,
and are exhibited for prizes just like the King's or the Prince of
Wales'." The worthy lady added that she couldn't help laughing to think
what a mistake she made in Holland when she was taken to see "Paul
Potter's Bull," which turned out to be only a picture.</p>

<h2>HINTS TO TOURISTS</h2>

<p>If you are put with a friend in a double-bedded room, bear in mind that
inside walls are only lath and plaster, and that every word you say will
be heard in the next room. Therefore carry on your conversation at the
tip-top of your voice, and make as much noise as you can in packing, and
in splashing, and in stumping round your room.</p>

<p>Always give to beggars who waylay you on the road, and if you know their
language, accompany your gift with a little stagey speech to the effect
that all we English have more money than we know how to spend, and it is
our duty when we travel to succour the distressed. This will mightily
encourage the impostors in their trade, and engender a great nuisance
for tourists who are poorer or less foolish than yourself.</p>

<h2>MR. PUNCH'S COUNTRY RAMBLES</h2>

<center>(<i>With acknowledgments to the "Daily Chronicle"</i>)</center>

<p>A memorable afternoon may be spent by taking the train to Muggleton, and
walking from there by way of Mudford, Sloppington,
Stickborough-in-the-Marsh, Drencham, St. Swithuns, and Swillingspout to
Poddleton-on-the-Slosh. The whole district is full of memories of the
great Hodge family (before it migrated into the towns). Quite a number
of mute, inglorious Miltons are buried in Poddleton churchyard, but a
few people may still be seen in the market-place on Saturdays.</p>

<p><i>Route of Ramble.</i>&mdash;Alighting at Muggleton Station (too much reliance
should not be placed upon the elocution of the local railway porter)
leave the refreshment room resolutely on the left (as you will need to
keep your intelligence clear), and proceed in a
north-north-east-half-northerly direction along a winding lane, until
Mudford Beacon appears in the rear. Then turn back across six meadows
and a ploughed field, following alternately the bed of a stream and the
right bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> of the canal until Sloppington is reached. From there follow
the boundary line between the counties of Mudshire and Slopshire as far
as Stickborough: from two to seven miles further on (according to the
best local computation) lies Drencham, where is a remarkable pump.
Leaving this landmark south-west-by-west, veer sharply to the left
twice, and pursue a zig-zag course. If, at the twenty-second field, you
are not within easy reach of Swillingspout it will be because you are
incapable of following this brief chronicle. From the last-named place
the nearest way to Poddleton is through the railway tunnel. It is not
public, but persons have sometimes succeeded in getting through.
Poddleton is nine miles from a station, but an omnibus walks the
distance occasionally, when the horse is not required for funerals or
other purposes.</p>

<h2>THE SKELETON TOURIST'S VADE MECUM</h2>

<p><i>Question.</i> What is your object this year?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> To follow the precedent of former Summers, and get over as
much ground as possible.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How do you manage this?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> With the assistance of a ticket guaranteed to make distance a
greater consideration than scenery.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is it necessary to examine the places <i>en route</i> with much careful
consideration?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Certainly not, as the Guide-book of the place visited will supply
the compulsory omissions.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What are compulsory omissions?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Objects of interest left out for want of time to give them an
inspection.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How long would you give St. Peter's at Rome?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> A quarter of an hour, and the Colosseum at the same place ten
minutes.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Could you not spare more time than this from your holiday?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p><i>A.</i> No; for luncheon and dinner have to be taken into consideration in
the touring table.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What object of interest would you examine in the Land of the
Midnight Sun?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The sun at midnight, if it happened to be shining.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And if you visited the Rhine by the railway, what object of
interest would chiefly attract your attention?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The interior of the compartment in which you happened to be
travelling.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What advantage would you derive from your tour?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The satisfaction of explaining to non-tourists where you had been
rather than what you had seen.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Do you consider that your mind would derive much benefit from your
rapid locomotion?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not much, nor my body either.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But I presume your outing would justify the title of this Vade
Mecum?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Most certainly; because, by the end of your journey, you might
accurately describe your condition as one who had been reduced to a
skeleton.</p>

<h2>A WHITSUN HOLIDAY.</h2>

<center>(<i>A Page from a Modern Diary.</i>)</center>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Up with the lark. Breakfast not ready. Spent my spare time in
closing the boxes. Got the family into the train with difficulty.
Devoted the day to travelling. Reached our destination tired out. Glad
to get to bed.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Up with the lark. Did the sights. Had no time to look at
anything, as I had to attend to the tickets. Saw all the museums. My
party coming out when I had got the catalogues. So managed our visits
that there was no opportunity of discussing meals. Got back in time for
<i>table d'hôte</i>, but preferred sleep to food. Went to bed.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Up with the lark. Off again travelling. On the road all
day. Having to fit in the corresponding trains, had no leisure for
meals. Arrived at our new resting-place late at night. So off as quickly
as possible to bed.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Up with the lark. Spent the morning in sight-seeing under
the customary conditions. Waited upon the family. Looked after the
catalogues and umbrellas. Food again at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> discount. Dispensed with
dinner. Glad to get to bed.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Up with the lark. Time to return. Back again by a train. No
food. No rest. Halfway home. Arrived in time to see the lights being put
out. Off to bed.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Up with the lark. Continued my journey post-haste. Wrote up
my diary. Find that I have got over several hundreds of miles; but for
the life of me cannot remember anything that I have seen. Don't
recollect any square meal. Back again, tired, and only pleased to be in
bed.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;Sleeping.</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Up with the lark. Recovered from my week's "rest," and glad
to get back again to work.</p>

<h2>EASTER HOLIDAYS</h2>

<center>(<i>By One who has tried them</i>)</center>

<p>Must really decide where to go for five or six days at Easter. Weather
always awful. Usual Springtime. North-east wind, frost, snow and dust.
Something like last week. Can't stop in London. One Sunday or Bank
Holiday in London mournful enough. But four of them consecutively!
Impossible!</p>

<p>Innocent persons go to the south coast of England, thinking that fifty
miles nearer the equator one is in quite a different climate.
Bournemouth? Bosh! All sandy dust and depressing invalids. Torquay?
Twaddle! Probably rain all the time, if not snow. England no good.
Scotland or Ireland? Worse!</p>

<p>Must go, as people say vaguely, "abroad." How about Paris? North-east
wind, frost, snow and dust, worse than here. Streets windy, theatres
draughty, cafés and restaurants suffocating. Brussels? Nothing but rain.
Aix-les-Bains? Probably snow. Nice? That might do. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> frost or snow,
but very likely a north-east wind and certainly lots of dust. Besides,

<h2>OVER THE SEA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I read that two new cures for sea sickness have just
been discovered: the one the eating of bananas; the other, found out by
Professor Heinz, of Erlangen, who declares that the malady proceeds from
the lobe of the brain, and that to avert it one has only to breathe
freely. As to the Professor's theory about breathing freely, I can
safely assert that I never open my mouth so wide as when crossing the
Channel, but the experiment is an unpleasant failure.</p>

<h2>SUMMER RESORTS</h2>

<center><span class="smcap">Dreardon-cum-Slooze.</span></center>

<p>Spring weather, in pleasing variety of sun and snow-shower, now prevails
in this highly fla&mdash;favoured locality. Mr. Josiah Jorker, Chairman of
the Rural District Council here, has bought four black Berkshire pigs,
and to lean over the yard gate and inspect them is now a regular
afternoon occupation. Discussion as to their merits runs high amongst
our local magnates. Situate as this health-giving village is, it offers
to the tired brain-worker complete rest, as there is no railway station
within six miles, and only the day-before-yesterday's newspaper is
obtainable.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Chawboodlecum.</span></center>

<p>A fine bracing N.E. wind has dried the roads, and, amongst the aged and
sick, made a clearance, thoroughly in accord with the "survival of the
fittest" doctrine. Trade has never been more brisk with the local
undertaker and the much-respected sexton. The cricket club opens its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
season to-day with a match against the neighbouring village of Sludgely.
A "Sing-Song," or "Free and Easy," is held every Saturday night at the
"Pig and Puppy-Dog," at which well-known hostelry visitors can find
every accommodation.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Slackington.</span></center>

<p>In this genial and mild air, where a steady, gentle rain falls on very
nearly every day in the year, the Londoner, fleeing from the trying east
winds of Spring, may find a welcome refuge. It is quite a pretty sight
on Sundays to watch the people with their different coloured waterproofs
stream out of church. There is a rumour that the present supply of cabs
will shortly be augmented by one, if not two, fresh vehicles. On Monday
last a German band played a charming selection of music in the market
place, and there was a dog-fight in the High Street.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Porkbury.</span></center>

<p>This charming spot only requires to be known, to insure plenty of
patronage from visitors. The new pump is being pushed forward rapidly,
and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> the Vicar intends to hold jumble sales once a week throughout the
summer. This, in itself, will, it is expected, prove a great attraction.</p>

<p>Police-Constable Slummers, whose urbanity and great consideration for
the inhabitants (especially on Saturday nights) have always been so
conspicuous, is about to leave, and some of the more prominent townsmen
have taken the opportunity of marking their sense of his valuable
services by presenting him with a handsome pewter pot, engraved with his
name and the date.</p>

<p>A piano-organist now regularly attends the weekly market, and his music
is greatly appreciated by those engaged in buying and selling.</p>

<p>At the Farmer's Eighteenpenny Ordinary, last week, Mr. Chumpjaw stated
that his mangolds were "the whackin'est big 'uns" grown in the county.</p>

<h2>BY THE SILVER SEA</h2>

<center><span class="smcap">Drainsmouth.</span></center>

<p>This popular health resort is now filled to over-flowing. The
entertainments on the pier include animated photographs of a procession
to the Woking Crematorium, and other cheerful and interesting subjects.
The smells of the harbour may still be enjoyed to perfection at low
water.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Shrimpley.</span></center>

<p>The question of mixed bathing here has at length been set at rest by the
Town Council issuing an order that nobody is to bathe at all. A decision
so impartial as between the rival factions cannot fail to give
satisfaction to all except the captious. Professor De Bach, with his
performing dogs, gives an exhibition twice each day at the Pier
Pavilion.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Lodgington-on-Sea.</span></center>

<p>Warm and sunny weather still continues in this favoured spot. People
wait half the morning for a bathing-machine and then look rather
disappointed when they get it. The Simperton-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> Swaggeringtons arrived
yesterday, travelling first-class from the junction, two miles off (up
to which point they had come third). This has excited some unfavourable
comment in the town.</p>

<center><span class="smcap">Smellington-Super-Mare.</span></center>

<p>Large numbers of tripp&mdash;visitors, I mean, continue to pour into the town
from Saturdays to Mondays, benefiting greatly by their small change. The
lodging-house keepers also derive considerable benefit from their (the
visitors') small change, especially when left lying about on the
mantelpiece. No one could complain of dulness here now, for as I write,
twenty-three barrel-organs, eleven troupes of nigger minstrels and four
blind beggars with fiddles are amusing and delighting their listeners on
the sands. The place is thoroughly lively, hardly an hour of the day
passing without at least two street rows between inebriated
excursionists taking place. The police force has been doubled, and the
magistrates have given notice that, for the future, they will give no
"option," and that all sentences for assaults in the streets will be
with hard labour.</p>

<h2>TIPS FOR TRAVELLERS</h2>

<p>Toddlekins is anxious to take his family to Mars this summer, and
inquires where he can hire a speedy balloon for the purpose. He is
anxious to know whether he can obtain golf there, and also whether the
roads are good for bicycling. He is recommended to apply for information
to the Astronomer-Royal. But why should Toddlekins trouble to go so far
afield? He would be sure to find congenial society in the neighbourhood
of Hanwell, and by selecting this spot as his destination, the expense
of a return ticket would be saved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anxious Mother.</span>&mdash;So glad that you intend taking your dear ten children
to Poppleton-on-Sea for three weeks' change of air. And all that you
tell me about Timothy's pet rabbit and Selina's last attack of measles
is so deeply interesting. Unfortunately I cannot answer all your
questions myself, but I will print them here, so that some of my kind
readers may be able to assist you. You want to know, in regard to
Poppleton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Whether the pavements (if any) are stone or asphalte.</p>

<p>(2) What is the mean temperature, the annual rain-fall, and the
death-rate.</p>

<p>(3) What are the Rector's "views," and if there is a comfortable pew in
the church, out of draughts, calculated to hold eleven.</p>

<p>(4) What time the shops at Poppleton close on Saturdays.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dubious.</span>&mdash;As you say, it <i>is</i> difficult to make up one's mind where to
spend the holidays, because there are so many places from which to
choose. And you were so wise to write and ask me to give you the name of
one single place which I could thoroughly recommend, and so save you all
further worry. How about Brighton, Hastings, Eastbourne, Bexhill,
Seaford, Cowes, Weymouth, Exmouth, Penzance, Lynton, or Tenby? I am
delighted to give you this real and valuable help!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Picnic-Party.</span>&mdash;You have my full sympathy. It is most churlish of
riparian owners to refuse to allow strangers to land on their property.
Fancy any one objecting to having his lawn covered with broken bottles
and paper bags!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Owner.</span>&mdash;I feel deeply for you. The way in which trippers on the river
invade riverside gardens is outrageous. The bags and pieces of glass

<h2>A COWES WEEK EXPERIENCE</h2>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Dear old Bluewater&mdash;what a good fellow he is!&mdash;asks me to
join his yacht, the <i>Sudden Jerk</i>, for Cowes week. Never been yachting
before.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Arrive Ryde Pier, correctly (I hope) "got up"; blue serge,
large brass anchor buttons, and peaked cap. Fancy Bluewater rather
surprised to see how <i>au fait</i> I am at nautical dress. "Ah! my dear
fellow, delighted to see you. Come along; the gig is lying alongside the
steps. One of the hands" (why "hands"?) "shall look to your traps." We
scramble into gig and are rowed out to 50-ton yawl. Climb up side.
Bluewater says, "Come below. Take care&mdash;two steps down, then turn round
and&mdash;&mdash; Oh! by Jove! what a crack you've caught your head. Never mind,
old boy, you'll soon get accustomed to it." Devoutly hope I shall <i>not</i>
get accustomed to knocking my head. Arrive at foot of "companion" (why
"companion"?) stairs. Bluewater pulls aside curtains and says, "<i>There</i>
you are!" Reply, "Oh! yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span> there I am. Er&mdash;is&mdash;do you lie on the
shelf&mdash;oh! berth, is it!&mdash;beg pardon&mdash;or underneath it?" He explains.
"You'll find it very jolly, you know; you can lie in your bunk, and look
right up the companion to the sky above." "Oh! awfully jolly," I say. We
repair on deck. Get under weigh to run down to Cowes. Dear old Bluewater
very active. Pulls at ropes and things, shouting
"leggo-your-spinach-and-broom,"<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and other unintelligible war-cries.
Stagger across deck. Breeze very fresh. "Lee oh!" shouts Bluewater;
"mind the broom!"&mdash;or it might have been boom&mdash;and next moment am
knocked flat on my back by enormous pole.</p>

<p>Arrive Cowes. Crowd of yachts. Drop anchor for night. Go below, damp
face in tiny iron basin; yacht lurches and rolls all the water out over
new white shoes. Enter saloon, tripping over some one's kit-bag at the
door. Try to save myself by clutching at swing-table, which upsets and
empties soup tureen all over my trousers. Retire, change, return. Host
and I sit down and proceed to chase fried soles backwards and forwards
across treacherous swing-table. "<i>Now</i>, my dear fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> isn't this
jolly? Isn't this worth all your club dinners?" Reply "Oh, yes,"
enthusiastically. Privately, should prefer club in London. Weather gets
worse. Try to smoke. Don't seem to care for smoking, somehow. Feel
depressed, and ask dear old Bluewater to describe a sailor's grave.
Tries to cheer me up by saying, "Don't waste the precious moments, my
friend, on such sad subjects. You are not born to fill a seaman's grave.
There's a class of man not born to be drowned, you know." Then he laughs
heartily. Try to smile; fail. Pitching and rocking motion increases.
Retire early and lie down on shelf. Fall off twice. Manage to reach
perch again. Weather gets worse. Shall never sleep with noise of
trampling on deck and waves washing yacht's sides. Shall never&mdash;&mdash;
Sudden misgiving. <i>Am</i> I going to be&mdash;&mdash;? Oh! no, must be passing
dizziness. It cannot possibly be.... IT IS!!!</p>

<p>Am rowed ashore, bag and baggage, next morning. Dear old Bluewater tries
to keep me from going, and says, "What, after all, <i>is</i> sea-sickness?"
Dear old Bluewater must be an ass. Confound old Bluewater!</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
